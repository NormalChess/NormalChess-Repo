# Normal Chess
> Extremely Super Duper Serious Chess Variant for grandmasters

*also this is a W.I.P outline of the variant, and things will change*

## Checks

There are no checks in Normal Chess (definitely not because I don't want to program them), capture your opponents king(s) to win.

## Pawn

The pawn is still a simple pawn, but with three changes. 

> En Passant Passant Passant Passant

The pawn can now surf "en passant," an example can be found here:

> King Promotion

The pawn can now promote to a king. The enemy has to capture both kings to win.

> Literally checkers

The pawn can jump over pawns (not pieces) vertically on the board, and can jump over more than one at a time.

Like checkers. (it is checkers)

## Knight

The knight broke it's legs. It cannot jump anymore. It can only walk between pieces to get to the square it normally could jump too.

## Chat

The chat is used for various reasons in Online Chess, be it trash talking, begging for a draw, or telling your opponent to resign right before you blunder your queen.

These are all terrible reasons to use the chat, so we added gameplay features to it. 

> Uno

Did you find yourself in a posistion where you only have your king left, and your opponent is mercilessly promoting to 7 queens? Don't worry. By simply typing, "uno"
into chat. You win. :)

> Black Jack

Do you find yourself bored waiting for your opponent to make a move? Or are you getting destroyed? Gamble it all by playing black jack while it isn't your turn. Type
the commands "hit", "stay", or "fold" to start playing black jack. 

By default you have 2 chips, and to win you have to get 11 chips. If you hit 21, you gain 2 chips. 
If you lose, you forfit one of your chips. 

When you get 11 chips as said before, you simply win the game. But if you lose all of your chips, you will lose the game.
