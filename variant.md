# Normal Chess
> Extremely Super Duper Serious Chess Variant for grandmasters

*also this is a W.I.P outline of the variant, and things will change*

## Checks

There are no checks in Normal Chess (definitely not because I don't want to program them), capture your opponents king(s) to win.

## Pawn

The pawn is still a simple pawn, but with three changes. 

> En Passant

The pawn can en passant every piece, and it does not take the piece it en passants. (unless a piece is on the en passant square it will move too, then it will take that piece)

En Passants are also only given if the piece who is going to be en passanted has moved once. En Passants can be done at any time, even if a new move has started.

> King Promotion

The pawn can now promote to a king. The enemy has to capture both kings to win.

> Literally checkers

The pawn can jump over pawns (not pieces) vertically on the board. It will take the piece it jumps over, you can chain these in only one direction.

Like checkers. (it is checkers)

## Knight

The knight broke it's legs. It cannot jump anymore. It can only walk between pieces to get to the square it normally could jump too.

Examples:

This knight has no moves

This knight has two moves (because it can physically walk to those squares, if it could move one square at a time)

## Queen

The queen is loyal to only it's own king, which means it cannot be caught cheating.

The queen cannot take the enemy king.

## Bishop

The bishop can only move on every other turn (depending on its starting square, example: if its on black, you can move turn one (if there was no pawns). if its on white, you'd have to wait till the next turn to move.)

## Rook

The rook is too tall for the pawn and thus cannot be captured by it (because it jumps over the piece, and it is too tall)

## Chat

The chat is used for various reasons in Online Chess, be it trash talking, begging for a draw, or telling your opponent to resign right before you blunder your queen.

These are all terrible reasons to use the chat, so we added gameplay features to it. 

> Uno

Did you find yourself in a posistion where you only have your king left, and your opponent is mercilessly promoting to 7 queens? Don't worry. By simply typing, "uno"
into chat. You win. :)

> Black Jack

Do you find yourself bored waiting for your opponent to make a move? Or are you getting destroyed? Gamble it all by playing black jack while it isn't your turn. Type
the commands "hit", "stay", or "fold" to start playing black jack. 

By default you have 2 chips, and to win you have to get 11 chips. If you hit 21, you gain 2 chips. 
If you lose, you forfit one of your chips. 

When you get 11 chips as said before, you simply win the game. But if you lose all of your chips, you will lose the game.
